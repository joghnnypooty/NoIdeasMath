# No Ideas Math
A Big Ideas Math hack designed to help students breeze through BIM assignments by showing them the answers to each question.

Source code is obfuscated to make it more difficult for Big Ideas Math to patch the hack. But you know what? Instead of trying to patch every method of cheating, just rebuild the education system from the ground up!


<h2>HOW TO RUN</h2>
* Log in to Big Ideas Math.

* Open an assignment. Wait until it loads completely (by this point you should see a question).

* Do Ctrl+Shift+J (or right-click and hit Inspect Element, and click Console on the top).

* Copy all the code in the <a href="https://github.com/theplummer/NoIdeasMath/blob/main/NoIdeasMath.js">BigIdeasMath.js</a> file.

* Paste the code in the console, then press enter. Voila! The hack has been activated!

**NOTE: This script is in development, which means that although it works for most questions, there may be some questions that it cannot answer! However, that should be alleviated in the future.**
